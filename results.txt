DESCRIPTION

The DIN result files are [JSON](https://www.json.org/) objects saved in plain text, using UTF-8 encoding.
The fields below are *mandatory*. Additional fields can be added as necessary for specific implementations.


STRUCTURE

A JSON object with the following keys:

version
	Type: string
	Description:
        	This is a read-only string. This specifies which version of the results specification we are following.
		This is useful to identify the result object version for automatic processing, especially if the format
		changes drastically in the future.

options
	Type: JSON object
	Description:
		A copy of the parameters as a JSON object.

origin
	Type: string
	Description:
		A description of the origin of the data. For example, if it is online, it can mention "web" and add
		the experiment id (e.g. "web: dbsplab.fun/2020-05-25-vodi-lexrev-tk-2.0"). For local implementations,
		this could be the name of the running environment ("matlab", "python") followed by the experiment id
		(e.g. "matlab: PICKA-XL/tk-st_ger0.1").

participant
   	Type: A JSON object with the following keys:

		age
			Type: float
			Description:
				The age in decimal years.

		sex
			Type: string
			Description:
				A free text entry.

		id
			Type: string
			Description:
				The identification token of the participant.

trials
	Type: array of 'trial' objects, where 'trial' objects have the following keys:

		digits_presented
			Type: array of integers
			Description:
				The presented digits. 

		digits_answered
			Type: array of integers
			Description:
				The presented digits.

		snr
			Type: float
			Description:
				The SNR value for the trial.
				
		next_snr
			Type: float
			Description:
				The SNR value calculated for the next trial.

		timestamp
			Type: string representation of date-time in MySQL format "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss"
			Description:
				For experiments ran locally, this can be the local time. For online experiment, it is
				recommended to make this the UTC time or to add time zone specification.

		correct
			Type: integer 1 or 0
			Description:
				1 if the answer is correct, 0 if it is not.
	
		sound_index
			Type: integer
			Description:
				The index of the presented sound in the list.
		
		sound_file
			Type: string or array of strings
			Description:
				The file name of the sound that was played. In case the digit triplet is assembled from individual
				files, then an array of file names should be stored.

list_id
	Type: string or integer
	Description:
		An identifier that allows to locate the list that was used for the sequence of digit triplets.
		This can be an integer index of the lists, or the name of the list, or the path to the list that
		was used.

din_score
	Type: float
	Description:
		Final DIN score, i.e. the average of the last n SNR values.

din_score_sd
	Type: float
	Description:
		The standard deviation calculated on the same SNR values the 'din_score' is calculated on.

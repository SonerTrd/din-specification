DESCRIPTION

This document lists the common options for generic digit-in-noise tests, across platform, languages and implementations.

The options described in the PARAMETERS section are all mandatory. The ones described in OPTIONAL PARAMETERS may be
considered for future implementations. All current implementations that do not implement these optional parameters should
behave according to the default value.


PARAMETERS

__version__
    Type: string
    Description:
        This is a read-only string. This specifies which version of the options specification we are following. This is
        useful to identify the options object version for automatic processing of the parameters if the format changes drastically
        in the future.

lang
    Type: string
    Description:
        The language of the test material. This has to follow the IETF language tag format, optionally with two-letter region subtags
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag). The code is composed of a 2-letter, lowercase language code that follows
        ISO 639-1 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). It is optionally followed by a dash ("-"), and a uppercase 2-letter region
        subtag that specifies the region where the variant of the language is used (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
        For instance Dutch from Netherlands is `nl-NL`, while Belgian Dutch is `nl-BE`.

material_source
    Type: string
    Description:
        This is a string describing where the material comes from. This is primarily intended to be read-only when interpreting
        results, but it could also be used to select between sources of materials.

presentation_method
    Type:  'diotic' | 'dichotic'
    Default: 'diotic'
    Description:
        How sound is presented
        - 'diotic': in mono on both ears
        - 'dichotic': antiphasic speech, noise in mono

starting_snr
    Type: number
    Default: TBD
    Description:
        The value of the SNR at the beginning of the test.

mixing_method
    Type: 'fixed_speech' | 'fixed_noise' | 'fixed_level'
    Default: 'fixed_noise'
    Description:
        How the speech and noise are mixed.
        - 'fixed_speech': The speech level is fixed.
        - 'fixed_noise': The noise level is fixed.
        - 'fixed_level': The overall level, after mixing, is fixed.
    Related parameters: fixed_level

fixed_level
    Type: number
    Default: Implementation dependent
    Description:
        The fixed level described by `mixing_method`. The value depends on the implementation. For instance, in Matlab, with
        a calibrated system, this may be the level in dB SPL or the RMS as calculated in Matlab.
    Related parameters: mixing_method

step_size
    Type: number
    Default: 2
    Description:
        The step size for the SNR, in dB.
    Related: step_size_first

max_snr
    Type: number
    Default: 12
    Description:
        The maximal SNR value, in dB. The SNR will nor be able to go above this value. In addition, the test may be stopped after a
        number of trial at this SNR occur.
    Related parameters: min_snr, stop_after_snr_saturation

min_snr
    Type: number
    Default: -12
    Description:
        The minimal SNR value, in dB. The SNR will nor be able to go below this value. In addition, the test may be stopped after a
        number of trial at this SNR occur.
    Related parameters: max_snr, stop_after_snr_saturation

stop_after_snr_saturation
    Type: number
    Default: +Inf
    Description:
        The number of trials at `min_snr` or `max_snr` we tolerate before stopping the test.

first_trial_repetition
    Type: True | False
    Default: True
    Description:
        Whether we repeat the first trial until it is reported correctly. In this phase, the step size is `step_size_first`.
    Related: step_size_first

din_score_average_over
    Type: integer > 0
    Default: 21
    Description:
        The number of trials the DIN-score is calculated over.


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

unordered_is_correct
    Type: True | False
    Default: False
    Description:
        Whether an answer is considered correct if the digits are returned in the wrong order.

trial_number
    Type: integer >= din_score_average_over
    Default: 24
    Description:
        The number of trials in the test. This is likely dependent on the available material. For instance the Dutch DIN comes
        in lists of 24 trials.
